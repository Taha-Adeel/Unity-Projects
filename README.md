# Unity-Projects

Different unity projects I created while learning Unity on [learn.unity.com](https://learn.unity.com/).

You can download and play the finished games from [Releases](https://github.com/Taha-Adeel/Unity-Projects/releases) (Download and extract the zip file from assets), or clone the repository and build them on Unity on your own.
