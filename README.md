# Unity-Projects

- Different unity projects I created while learning Unity on [learn.unity.com](https://learn.unity.com/).
- These multiple engaging 2D/3D games built using the Unity Engine utilize C# scripting for game logic and mechanics
- Have dynamic enemy spawns, basic AI, data persistence, and intuitive UI for enhanced gameplay experience.

All games can be previewed and downloaded from [Releases](https://github.com/Taha-Adeel/Unity-Projects/releases), and I highly recommend checking them out!

## Installation
You can download and play the finished games from [Releases](https://github.com/Taha-Adeel/Unity-Projects/releases) (Download and extract the zip file from assets), or clone the repository and build them on Unity on your own.
